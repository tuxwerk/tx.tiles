tx.slider installation
==========================

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``tx.slider`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        tx.slider
        
  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
